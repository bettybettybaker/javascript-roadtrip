// Challenge:

// The Park Rangers in Death Valley National Park divide up the feed
// responsibilities daily for the Bighorn Sheep population.
// Each sheep needs 2 lbs of ranger-provided food per day.

// Build a function called feedPerRanger that takes in:

    // The current population of sheep.
    // The number of Park Rangers available during the day.

// The function should alert the amount of feed that each Park Ranger
// should be responsible for on that day. The output should match the
// following format:

// Each Park Ranger should load <number> lbs of feed today.


///////////////////////// SOLUTION /////////////////////////

function feedPerRanger(    ) {
