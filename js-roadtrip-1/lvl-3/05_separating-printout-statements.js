// Challenge:

// Now, let’s say that Old Faithful’s eruptions are kept as separate variables,
// as you can see in the oldFaithful.js file.

// We’ve given you the avg variable for the average. Use the existing variables
// for eruption1, eruption2, eruption3, and numEruptions to calculate the
// average and assign it to the avg variable.


///////////////////////// PROBLEM /////////////////////////

var eruption1 = 112;
var eruption2 = 148;
var eruption3 = 160;
var numEruptions = 3;
var avg
